## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description

The CMOS inverter is a fundamental digital logic gate composed of one PMOS and one NMOS transistor. In this project:

* The circuit operates at **3.3 V**.
* The **PMOS** is connected to VDD and **NMOS** to GND.
* The **input (Vin)** is a square-wave pulse source.
* The **output (Vout)** shows complementary switching behavior.

Simulations are carried out using **eSim** (an open-source EDA tool integrating KiCad and Ngspice) to:

* Observe the **VTC curve** (using `.dc` sweep)
* Observe **transient response** (using `.tran` analysis)
* Demonstrate **correct inverter switching characteristics**

## üß™ How to Simulate

1. **Open in eSim**

   * Import the `.kicad_sch` and `.cir` files into eSim.
   * Map components to the NGSpice library if needed.

2. **Run SPICE Simulations**

   * **Transient Analysis**:

     ```bash
     ngspice CMOS_Inverter_with_PDK_include.cir
     ```

     *(Replace `sg13g_models.sp` with your PDK model path.)*

   * **DC Sweep**:

     ```bash
     ngspice CMOS_Inverter_DC_Sweep.cir
     ```

3. **View Results**

   * Use eSim‚Äôs waveform viewer or export `.raw` data.
   * Compare your output with `transient_waveform.png`.

## üìä Expected Results

* **VTC Curve:** Sigmoid-shaped curve with switching threshold near VDD/2.
* **Transient Output:** Complementary square wave (Vout ‚âà inverted Vin).
* **Noise Margins:** Derived from the VTC characteristics.
